This project implements a communication protocol as part of [emonmuc](https://github.com/isc-konstanz/emonmuc/) (**e**nergy **mon**itoring **m**ulty **u**tility **c**ommunication), based on the open-source project [OpenMUC](https://www.openmuc.org/), a software framework based on Java and OSGi, that simplifies the development of customized *monitoring, logging and control* systems.

# OpenSolarEdge

The [P-CHARGE systems by SSL Energie](https://www.ssl-energie.de/en/produkte/charging/p-charge/) is a complete series of charging stations for electric vehicles, from the simple charging pillar for electric bicycles, mopeds and electric cars to complete parking area systems for department store chains, communal park houses and parking areas.

This project implements a basic protocol driver and charge control application specifically for the DIN rail *EWS-Box*.


## 1 Installation

To setup this protocol driver, [emonmuc](https://github.com/isc-konstanz/emonmuc/) needs to be installed. To do so, a comprehensive guide is provided on the projects GitHub page.

With emonmuc being installed, the driver may be enabled

~~~
emonmuc install solaredge
~~~

To disable the driver, use

~~~
emonmuc remove solaredge
~~~

This shell command will set up the driver, as instructed in the [setup script](setup.sh).  
If there is the need to manually install the driver, the separate [installation guide](docs/LinuxInstall.md) may be followed.


## 2 Development

To provide an entrypoint for further developments, a generated [javadoc](https://isc-konstanz.github.io/OpenSolarEdge/javadoc/) can be visited.  
For other questions or initiatives please don't hesitate to file an issue or get into contact directly.
